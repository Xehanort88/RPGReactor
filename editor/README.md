# RPG Reactor

For the consolidated update, read the [0.98.6 release notes](../docs/posts/release-notes-0.98.6.md). Battle Rooms and visual Action Sequences are opt-in systems; see the [battle guide](../docs/BATTLE-PRESENTATION.md) and the [rigging guide](../docs/RIGGING-MODELS.md) for setup and current limits.

RPG Reactor 0.98.7 (in development) is an open-source, cross-platform RPG game editor and runtime for RPG Maker MV/MZ-compatible projects, built on NW.js, PixiJS v8 and Three.js. RPG Reactor provides its own modern runtime, PixiJS 8 for 2D and Three.js for HD-2D/3D maps, while preserving compatibility with RPG Maker project data and targeting backwards compatibility with both RPG Maker MZ and MV plugins. Create 2D and HD-2D RPG games with a complete development environment featuring map editing, event scripting, database management, and game testing capabilities.

## Features

### Map Editor
- **Multiple drawing tools**: Pencil, rectangle, circle area, fill bucket, shadow pen, and eraser use a shared high-contrast SVG style; the fill icon is a traditional pouring bucket, the shadow pen visibly darkens a tile, and Undo/Redo use a mirrored themed pair
- **Layer-aware erasing**: Eraser works as a modifier across pencil, rectangle, circle, and fill tools, targets the topmost real tile in auto mode, and supports imported RPG Maker maps with existing layer-0 base/autotile data
- **Layer system**: Four tile layers (0-3) with auto-layer mode for intelligent placement
- **Shadow pen mode**: Special layer effects for depth and atmosphere
- **Undo/redo**: Full history support (up to 50 steps)
- **Autotile support**: Automatic tile connection with animated water/waterfall tiles
- **Exact autotile placement**: Hold Shift while painting A1-A4 with Pencil, Rectangle, or Circle to place the selected shape without reconnecting it or changing neighboring autotiles
- **Six-plane rectangular sampling**: Right-drag captures tile layers 0-3, shadows, and regions; left-click/drag stamps the exact clipped patch with a live composite preview and one Undo entry per placement stroke
- **Region painting**: 256 distinct regions for gameplay triggers and restrictions
- **Map management**: Copy, paste, delete, and export whole maps from the map tree, including cross-instance map data, `MapInfos.json` entries, compatible tileset database references, and full-size PNG image output; pasted maps are inserted immediately after the selected map at the same hierarchy level
- **Map audio**: Autoplay BGM/BGS in Map Properties are chosen in the audio picker, which plays the track and sets its volume, pitch, and pan
- **Non-destructive resizing**: Changing a map's size reports the tiles and names the events that fall outside the new bounds, and makes no change until confirmed. A nine-cell anchor picker chooses which corner or edge content keeps, so a map can grow from the top or left; tiles and events move together, Set Event Location and `System.json` starts follow, and Transfer Player / Set Vehicle Location commands elsewhere that target the map are offered for adjustment. Top-left is the default and byte-identical to the previous behavior
- **Performance optimized**: Maps from 1×1 through 512×512 are validated before allocation. Large maps retain a buffered 32-tile-chunk viewport and merge ordinary tiles, autotile quadrants, shadows, and animated A1 water into GPU meshes, preserving full-map zoom without map-sized framebuffer caches
- **HD-2D map authoring**: Opt-in 3D maps preserve RPG Maker's grid and data while standing authored walls, roofs, panels, foliage, events, plugin lights, and parallax-backed ground. An event page can carry a mesh from `3d/<name>/source` (pose and facing marks in `Map###.r3d.json`) instead of a walking sheet. The 3D editor supports object/footing authoring, camera flight, hover targeting, event creation and dragging, and the same lower/character/starred composition order as runtime. Map Properties holds the 3D switch, the room a 3D map is built in (a parallax floor, walls, and ceiling at an authored height, `room` in `Map###.r3d.json`, walls and ceiling facing inward so the camera looks past them), and the map's Default Camera. Models carry their own effects (a database animation placed on a part or bone by clicking the model, previewed in the viewport) that animation timelines and the Play 3D Effect command fire. The palette's 3D-M tab places 3D model props on the map (size, per-axis stretch, facing, lift, passable, with a transform card of offset/rotate/scale sliders, a placement ghost under the cursor and Undo), moved by tile in 2D and freely with pose rings in 3D; the Transform 3D Model event command eases a placed model's offset, turn and scale in play; in play each prop is a model-bound event with footprint collision. Five camera modes are available: Fixed Angle (HD-2D), Top-Down, Isometric, Third Person, and First Person, each with optional pitch/yaw/distance/FOV overrides; the Change 3D Camera event command moves between them in play, eased over frames, focused on the display, player, or an event, and optionally kept across maps. Runtime PIXI 8 tile meshes repaint atomically and plugin row layers are prepared once before rendering, so lower, upper, and plugin-added layers remain complete and joined while the camera moves. Effects can also be video surfaces (an animated screen on a console) and play on demand, always, or by movement state; an effect's scale is relative to its model (100% = a model-sized frame). Effekseer effects are drawn inside the scene from the view's own camera, at full resolution, on a plane stood at the anchor, so a strut, a wall or a character in front hides them (the game does the same, drawing only the box the effect fills); a map with models is drawn under one depth buffer rather than the 2D upper-layer sandwich, so a screen or star tile behind a tower stays behind it as the view turns. Model collision follows the mesh (`collision: "box"` opts out): a tile is blocked when the mesh covers its middle or half of it, and the selected prop's blocked tiles are drawn in red in the editor; the map header's Passage toggle marks every cell the game will not walk, as RPG Maker's passage view does, including model footprints. Third and first person play with mouse look (the mouse turns the view as soon as it moves; a click takes it, Escape releases it and opens the menu), camera-relative WASD/arrows, looking up over the shoulder with the character's head following. The map's right-click menu sets the Player Facing at the start position, shown by an arrow on the marker; the 3D view draws the player and vehicle starts as labelled boxes. Number fields throughout the editor use themed ▲▼ steppers

### Event System
- **Visual event editor**: Create interactive objects, NPCs, and triggers
- **Show Text as a conversation**: A run of consecutive message boxes is edited as one strip (add, remove, reorder; overflow becomes more boxes and says so before OK), the text and name fields carry RPG Maker's right-click Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All/Insert Color/Insert Icon/Insert Control Character/Plugin Help menu, the Preview draws the boxes with the project's own windowskin, and a reference panel lists the codes that apply — vanilla, VisuStella MessageCore's when it is enabled, and the project's own custom codes. Troop battle events can open Show Text too
- **Transactional event workflow**: In Event mode, double-click an empty tile to open a detached default event; Apply or OK inserts it with one Undo snapshot, while Cancel or X leaves the map unchanged. Clicking the backdrop does not dismiss the editor. Double-click an occupied tile to edit it
- **Quick Event Creation**: Right-click an empty Event-mode cell to generate a Transfer, Door, Treasure, or Inn. Transfer and Door use the visual destination picker; Door/Treasure choose project graphics and suggest matching assets; Treasure supports gold/items/weapons/armors and an opened self-switch page; Inn authors the complete price, choice, recovery, and insufficient-funds flow. Creation is transactional and one Undo step
- **Multi-page events**: Conditional pages that change based on game state
- **100+ event commands** with dedicated editor UIs including:
  - Message display, choices, scrolling text, and input
  - Variable, switch, and self-switch control
  - Party, inventory, gold, and equipment management
  - Actor stats (HP/MP/TP/EXP/Level), skills, states, and parameters
  - Character movement, transfers, and vehicle control
  - Screen effects (tint, flash, shake, weather)
  - Picture commands (show, move, rotate, tint, erase)
  - Audio playback (BGM, BGS, ME, SE) and system audio settings
  - Battle processing, shop processing, and enemy manipulation
  - Map settings (tileset, parallax, battle background)
   - Complete MZ Conditional Branch editing: Switch, Variable, Self Switch, Timer, Actor, Enemy, Character, Gold, Item, Weapon, Armor, Button, Script, and Vehicle conditions with their MZ subtypes
   - Advanced Control Variables expressions for arithmetic, trigonometry, random, min/max, and bitwise operations
    - Direct stock Loop/Repeat Above insertion with nested-body preservation
   - Direct/variable Common Event calls, direct/variable current-map event-page calls, and extended keyboard/mouse/wheel/pointer conditions
   - Dynamic Picture IDs and duration, one/range/all erasure, angle, custom anchor, sine-wave, Overlay blend, and negative-scale Quick Setting preview
   - Nested-structure-safe If/Else and Show Choices editing, optional Else creation, loops, labels, and common events
   - Custom script and plugin command execution
- **Native Video Surfaces**: Reactor's Show/Transform/Stop Video Surface commands place WebM or MP4 against the screen, map, player, or an event. Layer, opacity, audio/playback rate, loop/wait, scanlines, culling, position, size, rotation, scale, depth, Z, and four local-pixel corners are authorable. Runtime PIXI handles 2D/all screen targets, projectively warps corners, leaves Z to the 3D view (the dragged position is the whole 2D placement), and measures culling in screen pixels. Runtime Three.js handles 3D map/event/player targets as rectangular planes with Z/world-camera culling and ignores corners. In the 3D view, pose rings around the surface rotate it by dragging. Saved commands preview through PIXI, Three.js, or a 3D-screen DOM bounding-box/clip approximation. All drag to move; PIXI projectively warps, DOM corner handles reshape its clip without perspective-correct pixels, and Three.js remains rectangular. Editor previews omit scanlines; only Three.js previews apply culling. Visible anchors, synchronized fields, and right-click exact source navigation remain available. The preview independently reduces every page without evaluating page conditions/runtime flow and forces media muted/looping; playtest honors authored playback. Preview state/resources are discarded without touching map or sidecar data
- **Portable advanced commands**: Stock-compatible forms stay ordinary stock command arrays. Reactor-only structured forms use syntax-checked, strictly versioned Script metadata and stock MV/MZ fallback bodies; modified or unknown tags remain normal Script commands rather than being reinterpreted
- **RPG Maker-style Game Data**: Control Variables opens a nested selector with database names, actor/enemy/character properties, party data, Other data, and every Last Action Data operand while preserving stock command parameters
- **Collapsible block structures**: Conditional Branch, Show Choices, and Loop fold from the arrow beside them, badged with the hidden line count. Nested blocks keep their own state, folds track the command rather than its position so edits above a block don't strand them, and fold state persists per project/map/event/page across restarts
- **Copy/paste support**: Exchange whole events, event pages, command blocks shared across map/Common/Troop events, troop battle pages, and movement-route command selections between RPG Reactor instances
- **Find/search**: Locate events across your project

### Database Editors
Comprehensive editors for all game data in a near-full-viewport workspace with fixed shell controls and independently scrolling navigation, list, and detail panes. Web layouts retain the same scroll ownership and reflow specialized workspaces on narrow screens. Actors, Classes, Skills, Items, Weapons, Armors, Enemies, and States support an optional editor-only name in `data/Database.names.json`; Options can lead with that label, trail with it, or show only the in-game name, while search matches both. The sidecar never changes RPG Maker records and is excluded from game deployments. Standard entry lists provide right-click clipboard operations (Copy, Cut, Paste, Duplicate), keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+C/X/V/D, Delete, Ctrl+Z undo), shortcut isolation so database tools do not conflict with map or event editing, and typed cross-instance transfer for every top-level record category including Tilesets. Cross-project paste keeps the destination slot ID and rejects a record copied from a different database category. Change Maximum displays workload-aware ceilings with defensive model validation; major databases/Common Events retain 9,999 slots, Animations support 5,000, and Tilesets retain 1,000, while every Type list exceeds MZ's traditional 99-entry range. Large databases remain one continuous list: 250 rows appear immediately and later batches append while scrolling. Oversized imported arrays remain readable and can be reduced. Actors support level 999 through extrapolated Class curves, action repeats support 100 with runtime enforcement, and 2,000 maps can use IDs through 9,999. Entry lists show a framed mini icon beside each name — database icons for skills, items, weapons, armors, and states; face portraits for actors; battler thumbnails for enemies. Skills, Items, and Weapons assign animations through a searchable picker modal with a live playing preview of both sprite-sheet and Effekseer animations:

| Editor | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Actors** | Create player characters with stats, equipment, traits, and clickable character/face sheet cell selection; the character, face, and side-view battler each independently switch to a 3D model |
| **Classes** | Define jobs with responsive parameter curves, directly editable learnable skills, and EXP formulas |
| **Skills** | Design abilities with damage formulas, MP/TP costs, visible button/double-click effects CRUD, required weapon types, and invocation settings including an animation picker |
| **Items** | Create consumables with damage formulas, TP gain, visible button/double-click effects CRUD, usage restrictions, and an animation picker |
| **Weapons** | Configure weapons with parameters, elements, traits, and an attack animation picker |
| **Armors** | Set up defensive equipment with parameters, resistances, and full trait editing |
| **Enemies** | Build enemies with visual battler preview (charset-aware), hue slider with live preview, parameters including a per-enemy Max TP, action patterns whose conditions can require states the user or a target has or lacks, drop items, directly editable action patterns, traits, and an optional 3D battler model |
| **Troops** | Compose enemy groups in a two-column workspace with a runtime-aligned preview on the left, stacked Battle Test/Members/Battleback/Note controls on the right, class-filtered Battle Test equipment, aligned Conditions dialog, and full-width event page scripting below |
| **States** | Define status effects with controls-first aligned duration/removal settings, `%1` Actor/Enemy message guidance, parameter changes, and full trait editing |
| **Animations** | Create up to 5,000 Effekseer or MV-style sprite battle animations in a dense responsive workspace with scaled 960x540 preview editing, compact sprite sheets/properties, locally scrolling frames/effect controls, and an independent scrolling SE/Flash timing column; timing SE can live in recursive subfolders |
| **Tilesets** | Configure tile passage, terrain tags, special flags, Change Maximum, and Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V slot copy/paste; A-E previews support Unicode and URL-significant project/image paths without requiring an initialized map renderer |
| **Common Events** | Script reusable event sequences with trigger conditions |
| **System 1** | Game-wide settings including title, party, audio, battleback, and vehicle options; all 24 system sounds support multiple takes and an optional 50-150% random pitch range; Player/Boat/Ship/Airship start locations use a transaction-safe visual map picker or manual Map/X/Y fields, and title images use searchable Unicode navigation with a side-by-side preview |
| **System 2** | Menu commands, item categories, attack motions, editor settings, asset sizes, advanced options, and an ordered fillable Magic Skills list of Skill Type IDs controlling side-view casting motion |
| **Types** | Five simultaneous ID-preserving lists for Elements, Skill Types, Weapon Types, Armor Types, and Equipment Types, with multiselect, keyboard and context-menu Cut/Copy/Paste, bulk clear, Add, and confirmed Change Maximum |
| **Terms** | One compact workspace for Basic Statuses, Parameters, Commands, and the complete grouped Messages schema with text clipboard context menus |
| **3D** | Browse the project's `3d/` model library in folders, carve any mesh region into a named part, rig static models with Humanoid/Quadruped/Plant/Vehicle skeletons, apply preset motions, and author every pose, swing, spin, bob, clip, keyframe timeline, and timed effect on one slider card with live preview. Bindings live in `data/Database.r3d.json` and per-model `model.json` / `model.rig.bin` sidecars; an Effects section names animations, video/image surfaces, and lights anchored on the model (placed by clicking it or dragging the marker, offset/rotate/scale on the card with a live preview) for the Play 3D Effect command and animation timelines |
| **Quests** | Author quest categories, descriptions, objectives, visibility rules, and descriptive rewards; import VisuStella, Yanfly, or GS definitions. Reactor stores definitions in `data/ReactorQuests.json`, separately from plugin quest files; progress saves with the game. The on-map tracker and automatic reward grants are not built |
| **User Interfaces** | Author Box, Image, Text, Button, Gauge, and typed List nodes as interactive scenes or display-only map HUDs. Seven generated baselines and seven opt-in, role-safe replacements cover Title, Main Menu, Game End, Status, Options, Save, and Load; stock fallback remains automatic. Named List contexts, actor bindings, functional Options and Save/Load rows, detailed typography/state/focus styling, transitions, live visual capture, and runtime preview are built. Records live in `data/UserInterfaces.json`, invisible to stock RPG Maker |

### Rendering and model optimization

The shared Three.js/PIXI WebGL path renders the 3D world at game resolution by
default (`Reactor3D.maxPassPixelRatio = 1`), enlarges it with nearest sampling,
and uses no MSAA. A project may opt into native-resolution passes or MSAA;
adaptive resolution is off by default. Main-canvas/UI resolution also depends
on GPU tier. See [current rendering status](../docs/STATUS.md).

Volume lights use distance and point/spot/beam shape; surface normals and normal
maps do not contribute to this lighting model. Shadow atlases budget 8 static /
3 dynamic light rows on full quality and 4 / 2 on weak quality. Rows are cached
and prioritize light incident on the player, so a light's casting flag does not
guarantee a shadow row when the budget is full. Model lights exclude their own
carrier from the shadow pass.

GLB import and the 3D database's Optimize action offer texture capping, skin
weight packing, geometry reduction, and GPU cache ordering. Both presets can
reduce geometry; inspect the result on an animated model where applicable.
Separate LOD-file generation is off in both presets. Existing authored levels
still load; automatic in-memory levels remain planned.

### Custom User Interfaces

The editor is canvas-first: **Layers** is explicitly Back -> Front and supports
subtree-safe endpoint moves and drag reorder/reparent. A compact toolbar leaves
interface Behavior, Transitions, and Notes in **Inspector**. At the default
1280x720 window, the Inspector is a closed contained drawer whose current state
is Interface Settings; selecting a layer or pressing Interface Settings opens
it. Detail panes wider than 1050px keep all three panels in-row, while
one-column reflow begins at 620px. **Use As** remains a searchable checkbox combobox whose
default **Custom** value is based on System assignments. The
collapsible **Game Reference** tray pins its reference behind authored layers and
imports only through explicit Starting Layout / Add to Front actions.
- **Typed Lists and named contexts**: Lists source party actors, categorized inventory, a bound actor's skills/parameters/equipment/states, Options, save slots, variable ranges, or literal rows. Rows carry stable source-qualified identity plus typed display fields. Selection immediately publishes the row under an authored context name for `{context.*}` text, actor-aware nodes, and semantic actions; confirmation can first store the row ID or value in a game variable.
- **Actor binding and tokens**: Text, party-face Image, Gauge, and actor Lists bind to a fixed party slot, fixed actor ID, current menu actor, actor ID in a variable, or actor from a named List context. Tokens cover name, nickname, class, level, profile, HP/MP/TP and maximums, current/total/next EXP, next required EXP, and ATK/DEF/MAT/MDF/AGI/LUK. Slot escape codes include `\GOLD`, `\PLV[n]`, `\PCLASS[n]`, `\PHP[n]`, `\PMHP[n]`, `\PMP[n]`, `\PMMP[n]`, and `\PTP[n]`.
- **Gauges and typed rows**: Gauges show HP, MP, TP, level-relative EXP, MHP, MMP, all six combat parameters, or a variable against a fixed/variable maximum. Labels, current/current-max/percent/hidden value formats, two bar colors, background color, and bar height are configurable. Inventory, actor, Options, and save rows expose useful typed fields to row templates and context-bound detail nodes.
- **Functional Options and files**: Options rows mutate Always Dash, Command Remember, Touch UI where available, and all four audio volumes with MZ-style toggling, 20-point volume steps, wrapping, immediate refresh, and `ConfigManager` persistence. Save/Load rows expose slot metadata and enabled state; their async operations lock duplicate input, preserve stock before/after-save/load lifecycle, recover focus on failure, and enter the map only after a successful load.
- **Generated records and replacement safety**: Stable IDs are 1 Title Screen, 2 Main Menu, 3 Game End, 4 Status, 5 Options, 6 Save, and 7 Load. Existing interface files are unchanged, and the Demo contains these records with no replacement bindings by default. The exact opt-in roles are Title, Main Menu, Status, Game End, Options, Save, and Load. Missing, malformed, overlay, ID-mismatched, or role-mismatched selections use stock; routing is reinstalled after plugins load so plugin wrappers remain in the call chain.
- **Styling and navigation**: Text/Button/List typography includes font face, size, bold, italic, text color, outline color/width, letter spacing, wrapping, and fit-to-size. Nine-slice is restricted to Picture and System images. Buttons and Lists support focused, pressed, and disabled overrides; directional focus targets override geometric navigation with safe fallback. Interfaces open/close with none, fade, or slide-left transitions.
- **Capture and overlays**: Capture from Game opens supported stock scenes with project plugins and converts recognized engine draws into an editable visual draft. Capture itself only updates the cache/reference; explicit node imports remain unsaved database edits, while importing the Picture fallback immediately copies a PNG into `img/pictures`. Direct canvas/plugin behavior and complete workflows cannot always be inferred and must be reviewed. Overlay records attach only to maps, reevaluate visibility, and are display-only/input-transparent.
- **Current boundaries**: There is no Container node, general flow layout, or alignment-guide system. Item, Skill, Equip, Shop, Formation, Name Input/message inputs, and Battle remain stock and unreplaceable pending dedicated workflow adapters; Main Menu can select an actor and launch stock Skill/Equip or the configured Status role. Arbitrary named plugin scenes and Shop replacement are not supported. The standalone MZ plugin is deferred per owner direction, not the next active task.

### Audio Player
- **Multi-channel playback**: BGM, BGS, ME, and SE tracks
- **Formats**: OGG, MP3, WAV, FLAC, and M4A, with per-format loop tags (`LOOPSTART`/`LOOPLENGTH` comments, ID3 `TXXX`, WAV `smpl`) and embedded album art shown beside each track; the same interface and one shared extraction cache back every audio picker, System music/sound picker, event command, and plugin audio field in the editor
- **Playback controls**: Volume, pitch, pan, and seek
- **Loop configuration**: Set custom loop points
- **BGM sequences**: Map Properties sequences repeat ordered tracks, silence, and layered palettes with random pools, timing, and fades. Native track loop points are ignored inside a sequence
- **Real-time preview**: Play BGM/BGS/ME/SE in map, Common, and Troop events uses the same current art-backed browser, native loop points, seek/transport controls, and volume/pitch/pan preview as system audio and map autoplay settings
- **Unicode filename index**: The left rail uses normalized Unicode initials and locale-aware ordering; numbers and punctuation remain under `#`
- **Recursive folders**: BGM, BGS, ME, and SE browsers discover nested files and preserve extensionless relative names such as `Boss/Phase 2`
- **System-sound variation**: Each of the 24 stock slots keeps its primary RPG Maker sound plus uniformly selected optional variants and an absolute pitch range. Older Reactor/stock MZ plays the primary. The optional keys live in `System.json`, so opening and saving that file through RPG Maker MZ's own editor can discard the pool and range.

### Event Priority
- **Above Characters (Sorted by Y)**: a fourth priority for props that must sit above the tile layers (a console over its tiles) but still belong in the scene. Characters behind it are covered as with Above Characters; a character standing in front of it draws over it. Walk-through like Above Characters; block the tile if it should be solid

### Event Preview
- **Preview Event**: right-click an event and pick a page to draw that page's graphic on the map at its real size and position (feet at the tile, object sheets unshifted), under the event marker. Hide it from the same menu. Stepping pages animate, 3D-model pages show the model (placed in the 3D view, a front render at footprint size in 2D), and the choice is remembered per event in the map's Reactor sidecar. Works in both the 2D and 3D views. In-game, model-bound events on maps that are not rendered in 3D draw as that same front render, so a 3D prop can live in a 2D world

### Resource Manager
- **One project catalog**: Tools > Resource Manager lists categories alphabetically in the current locale and searches nested image, audio, effect, movie, font, application-icon, and Reactor 3D folders while preserving each file's real physical path and encrypted storage identity. A dedicated cyan/gold SVG icon also opens it from the Tools toolbar
- **Media and model previews**: Images, audio, video, and fonts preview in place. 3D models reuse the Reactor3D parser, texture resolution, camera, and template-cloning framework with drag orbit and wheel zoom; effects retain metadata-only browsing
- **Model animation/effect clipboard**: In Database → 3D Models, select a saved animation or effect in the right-hand lists and press Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V (Cmd on macOS), or right-click for Edit, Copy, Paste, Duplicate and Delete. Paste creates a uniquely named copy and opens it for editing. Copies work between models and include an animation's referenced named effects; retarget part/bone or embedded-clip names when the destination model differs.
- **Multi-file export**: Ctrl/Cmd-click toggles files and Shift-click selects a range. Batch export preserves nested paths, disambiguates physical aliases, and emits original plain bytes even when the project stores the assets encrypted
- **Safe desktop import**: Multi-file imports target an existing nested folder, validate filenames, extensions, file signatures, collisions, symlink-free ancestry, project identity, and the live project lock, then use an atomic write. Alternate audio/movie formats with the same base name may coexist. PNG/APNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, GIF, and restricted self-contained SVG images are validated before writing
- **Transactional model import**: The read-only 3D catalog allows one special creation path without enabling deletion. A user-named nested model folder accepts GLB, OBJ, FBX, STL, USDZ, 3MF, or DXF after triangle/geometry validation; GLB buffers and images must be embedded, and `.blend` must be exported first. Import stages `source/<case-preserved filename>` plus an empty `textures/`, reserves the exact destination, rechecks project/staging identity, and publishes without merging or replacing an existing folder. Failures roll back owned staging and newly created empty parents
- **Encrypted-project support**: Image/audio imports are encrypted with the project's validated key and fail without writing if no key can be recovered
- **Conservative mutations**: Delete warns that references are not scanned and repeats physical path/lock checks. Existing Reactor 3D files and folders cannot be deleted or replaced through Resource Manager; only the transactional new-model import above is allowed. Web can browse, preview, and export but cannot import or delete in this version

### Multi-Instance Editing
- **Multiple project windows**: Launch separate RPG Reactor windows for different projects
- **Same-project protection**: Per-project lock files prevent opening the same project twice at the same time, and a live lock reports only that conflict rather than a misleading invalid-project error
- **Cross-instance clipboard**: Typed clipboard support for maps, multi-selected batches from all top-level database categories, individual trait/effect rows, whole events, event/troop pages, structural map/Common/Troop command blocks, movement-route commands, and plugin JSON/settings. Database lists support Ctrl/Cmd/Shift selection and keep their viewport stable after batch operations. Trait/effect database and Type references resolve by unique exact name in the target project; missing or duplicate matches reject the paste. Other source assets and numeric references are not remapped

### Project Loading & Compatibility
- **Recursive asset discovery**: Project-facing pickers recursively index animation sheets, Effekseer effects, characters, faces, battlers, tilesets, battlebacks, parallaxes, title images, audio, and plugin file parameters. Stored names always use RPG Maker-compatible forward-slash relative paths; `$` and `!$` sheet markers are read from the nested filename rather than its parent folders. Face sheets retain four 144px columns but may contain more than two rows
- **Safe desktop asset URLs**: The central desktop resolver emits standards-compliant POSIX, Windows-drive, and UNC `file:` URLs, preserving spaces, `#`, `%`, `?`, and Unicode while encrypted assets continue to use decrypted `data:` URLs
- **Modern image references**: Converted consumers support PNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, safe SVG, and GIF across battlebacks, parallaxes, enemy detail, titles, animations, event character/face pickers and previews, Change Actor Images, Change Vehicle Image, System 1 vehicle selection, Pictures, Resource Manager, Reactor UI Picture nodes, and runtime `ImageManager`. PNG values remain extensionless; explicit modern extensions remain stored and retry legacy `<name>.<ext>.png`. Encrypted MIME types remain correct and animated GIF sprite/tiling-sprite textures refresh. Tilesets, plugin-parameter image fields, database actor/list thumbnails, Reactor UI character/face/party-face/System/Title/Icon sources, balloon sheets, and fixed system sheets such as IconSet retain PNG-oriented/storage contracts.
- **Searchable Unicode picker index**: Character, face, battler, vehicle, and animation-image browsers filter live by full relative path with case/accent-insensitive matching. A left Unicode rail and sticky section headers provide direct jumps for Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, CJK, kana, Hangul, and `#` names; results are keyboard-selectable
- **Resilient JSON reads**: Project metadata and database files retry short-lived partial/locked reads, accept UTF-8 BOMs, and report the failing filename and reason
- **Single-owner map metadata**: `MapInfos.json` is parsed once during project opening and remains controller-owned
- **Safe MV launch metadata**: Install Reactor Runtime and desktop playtest repair only missing, non-string, or blank package `name`/`main` fields while preserving custom MV/NW.js settings; malformed packages fail before conversion or launch
- **Versioned project runtime**: Opening an existing Reactor project refreshes engine-owned runtime files to the editor version before loading game data while preserving `reactor_plugins.js` and unrelated third-party plugins

### Plugin System
- **Plugin discovery**: Automatically finds plugins in your project
- **Enable/disable toggle**: Control which plugins are active
- **Load order management**: Arrange plugin execution order
- **Parameter configuration**: Edit plugin settings through the UI
- **Shared choice annotations**: Plugin parameters, nested struct fields, and plugin command arguments share `@option`/`@value` parsing and controls for `combo`, `select`, and their array forms. Declared values are stored instead of display labels, combo values remain editable/searchable, spaced argument keys and Format B headers work, and arrays preserve their RPG Maker string/array representation
- **Typed plugin references**: All RPG Maker database and System reference types, including array forms, use searchable ID pickers with `(None)`, unknown-ID preservation, index-accurate labels, and icon escape-code previews. Colors, authored Boolean labels, and multiline values use dedicated controls on every plugin surface
- **Plugin image browsers**: `@type file` and `file[]` fields under `img/...` use the shared recursive folder tree and show the selected image with its pixel dimensions across Plugin Manager parameters, nested structs, and Plugin Command arguments. Desktop and Web previews support plain and encrypted project assets
- **Atomic MZ plugin commands**: Code 357 commands save readable ordered 657 argument rows and remain one structural block during editing, insertion, selection, copy, cut, delete, and paste on maps, Common Events, and Troops. Partial metadata preserves unknown authored rows, and malformed complex values stay raw-editable
- **Searchable help**: Long `@help` guides highlight all literal case-insensitive matches with active/total counts, wraparound previous/next controls, Enter/Shift+Enter, F3/Shift+F3, and Plugin Manager-scoped Ctrl/Cmd+F navigation
- **Searchable plugin lists**: Filter loaded plugins by name, description, or author without changing load-order identity; the Add Plugin dialog also filters available plugin filenames
- **Persistent actions**: Remove Plugin and Save Changes remain at the bottom of the manager, with Save on the right and available regardless of list selection
- **Schema-driven complex parameters**: MV/MZ `struct<T>`, nested struct arrays, and simple arrays render as named aligned forms with multiline notes and Add/Edit/Delete/reorder controls. Rows support double-click editing and direct full-row drag-and-drop with visible insertion feedback, while alternating list surfaces and neutral group headers follow every active theme. Element editors use an explicit OK action. Nested editors keep the source plugin's definitions, Cancel does not mutate the outer draft, Structure/Text tabs synchronize safely, JSON-looking strings remain strings, and saves restore RPG Maker's nested JSON-string encoding
- **Parameters for plugins with no annotations**: A plugin's schema lives only in the comment block at the top of its file, and obfuscated releases ship without it — nothing can read those in Reactor or in RPG Maker's own Plugin Manager. The saved values are read for their shape instead: an object becomes a struct, a list of objects a list of them, `true` a checkbox, and a JSON-encoded string a note that is re-encoded on save. Keys carrying their own type suffix (`QoL:struct`) are labelled without it. A parameter is only offered as structured when saving it reproduces the stored text exactly, so a misread shape falls back to a plain text box rather than rewriting a value
- **Multi-line text**: `@type multiline_string` renders as a resizable text area and is written back exactly as typed, unlike `note`, which RPG Maker stores JSON-encoded
- **Multi-select actions**: Shift-click and Ctrl/Cmd-click plugins to copy, cut, paste, duplicate, or remove groups across windows
- **RPG Maker-safe saves**: Existing MV/MZ projects keep `js/plugins.js` in RPG Maker's standard `name`/`status`/`description`/`parameters` format; Reactor-only parsed help, author, and URL metadata stays editor-only

### Playtest
- **One-click testing**: Launch your game instantly from the editor
- **Debug mode**: Test with development features enabled
- **Playtest checkpoints**: Slot 99 is written after battles and map transfers in test mode; F9 on the title loads the checkpoint. This is separate from ordinary player save slots and is disabled outside test mode
- **Built-in frame profiler**: Press F10 in any playtest (or deployed game) to record per-phase frame timings; a second press writes `save/reactor-profile.json` attributing every slow frame
- **Process management**: Start and stop playtests easily
- **Start-map validation**: Repairs invalid player and vehicle start-map references before launch when maps have been deleted
- **Packaged editor support**: Final editor builds launch playtests through a clean NW.js runtime on Windows, macOS, and Linux so the editor package is not accidentally relaunched as the game
- **Isolated profiles**: Every project uses its own Reactor-managed NW.js playtest profile on Windows, macOS, and Linux, preventing a deployed game or another project from blocking playtest launch
- **Package preflight**: Launch-critical `package.json` metadata is validated before NW.js starts, preventing MV projects with an empty `name` from reaching NW.js's generic required-value error

### Build & Deploy (Games)
- **Cross-platform builds**: Package games for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Web (HTML5)
- **Standalone executables**: No runtime dependencies for players
- **Custom icons**: Game builds embed your project's `icon/icon.png` into Windows `.exe` and macOS `.app`; Linux uses runtime icon. Falls back to NW.js default if no icon is found
- **Asset bundling**: Game files copied into `package.nw` alongside NW.js runtime
- **NW.js runtime options**: Reuse bundled/cached runtimes first or download from dl.nwjs.io; choose latest stable, the editor's version, or an exact version through a themed selector searchable by version or release date
- **Runtime locales**: Optionally retain only selected Chromium locale families in desktop packages; English is always kept as a fallback and project translation assets are untouched
- **Desktop proprietary codecs**: Game and full editor deployments default to an exact-version `nwjs-ffmpeg-prebuilt` H.264/AAC overlay, verified against a checked-in trusted SHA-256 manifest and cached separately. Users may disable it; unchecked builds acquire a clean official runtime so an existing overlay cannot leak into the package. Codec packages include the LGPL 2.1 text, immutable corresponding-source/build references, and a patent notice
- **Optional asset optimization**: Deploy Game can losslessly recompress staged PNG files with Oxipng and optionally compress every supported audio format at an explicit quality. OGG, MP3, and M4A re-encode in place with their corresponding encoders; WAV and FLAC convert to OGG. Existing project files are never modified, larger or invalid results are discarded, and native loop points are preserved. Embedded cover art is retained when FFmpeg can carry it through safely; a failed art-preserving encode retries without art rather than failing the deployment. Audio optimization automatically downloads a pinned, SHA-256-verified FFmpeg executable into a separate cache on first use; the corresponding GPL license and verification manifest are retained beside it. Per-file progress appears in the existing build log and progress bar
- **Persistent choices**: Game output directory, runtime locales, PNG optimization, and audio quality are restored independently on the next editor session. Lossy audio compression starts unchecked for every deployment
- **Optional Linux AppImage**: On Linux x86_64 build hosts, Linux game deployment can also emit one portable `.AppImage` file beside the normal Linux folder. The existing folder remains unchanged, and the AppImage option is off by default
- **Web export**: HTML5 builds for browser deployment
- Access from **Build → Create Deployment Package...**

### Editor Distribution Builder
Package the RPG Reactor editor itself for desktop or web distribution.

- **4 package types**:
  - **Platform-Specific**: One ZIP (`.zip`) archive per OS with bundled NW.js runtime; Linux and macOS symlinks are preserved
  - **Universal**: Single ZIP (`.zip`) archive containing all 3 platform runtimes
  - **Minimal**: Editor-only package, bootstrap launchers auto-download NW.js on first run
  - **Web**: Browser editor with Reactor One bundled and opened automatically; mutable project data is persisted in the browser and Playtest runs in-page
- **Web hosting**: Extract the Web ZIP at the desired URL and serve it over HTTPS, or use `localhost` while developing. Opening `index.html` directly with `file://` cannot provide the service-worker scope used for saved Playtest data
- **Browser storage**: Edits are stored per site origin in IndexedDB. The Web editor's Reset control discards those browser-saved edits and restores the bundled Reactor One project
- **NW.js editions**: Normal or SDK (includes DevTools for development/debugging)
- **3-tier runtime acquisition**: Checks bundled local and packaged-editor runtimes → every `.nw-cache/` location → downloads from `dl.nwjs.io`; official stable-version metadata is cached for offline reuse
- **Responsive downloads**: Build workers prefer native `curl` when available to avoid NW.js worker-network stalls, retain a Node HTTPS fallback, write cache files atomically, retry temporary failures, and show transferred bytes in the deployment log
- **Verified codec acquisition**: Exact NW.js release match only → `.nw-codec-cache/` reuse → GitHub release download, with archive digest and single-file content validation before installation
- **Persistent output**: The editor distribution output directory is remembered separately from the game deployment directory
- **Package scope**: Optional proprietary codecs are available only for full platform/universal packages; Minimal and Web packages contain no bundled NW.js runtime to patch
- **Optional editor AppImage**: A platform-specific Linux editor build can additionally emit an x86_64 `.AppImage` beside its ZIP when packaging on Linux x86_64. The ZIP remains available
- **Verified AppImage tooling**: First use downloads separately cached, immutable GitHub assets for `appimagetool` and the Type 2 runtime, checks both against built-in SHA-256 hashes, and embeds portable desktop metadata, icons, and the runtime license
- **SHA256 checksums**: Automatically generated for all output archives
- **Playtest-safe runtime layout**: Windows/Linux platform packages append the editor payload to the branded executable while leaving `nw.exe`/`nw` clean for playtest; macOS packages as a self-contained `.app` with an internal clean playtest runtime that symlinks to the bundled NW.js framework
- **Windows compatibility mode**: Windows editor packages use frameless RPG Reactor title controls, centered startup, and manual maximize/restore behavior so running the Windows build under Proton/Wine on Linux avoids native-frame white bars and click offsets
- Access from **Build → Package Editor for Distribution...**

Maintainers can produce the same release worker configuration non-interactively
with `node build-scripts/release-editor.cjs --target <linux|windows|macos|web>
--mode <candidate|publish> --version <package-version> --output-root <directory>`.
The CLI pins NW.js 0.107.0, creates a fresh versioned output directory, and
writes a hashed artifact manifest. Publish mode additionally requires a clean
checkout and verified native signing/notarization. See
[`../docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md`](../docs/RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md).

### Forge - In-editor Asset Generators

Suite of in-editor tools for generating game assets without leaving RPG Reactor. Open from the **Forge** menu.

#### Animation Generator
Procedural sprite-sheet generator for visual effects and projectile animations.

- **Layered composition**: Stack multiple animations as layers; per-layer visibility, opacity, and blend mode (`source-over`, `add`, `multiply`, `screen`, etc.)
- **Keyframe timeline per layer**: Drop keyframes at any frame; sliders and colors interpolate linearly between them and textures cross-fade smoothly so a single layer can morph through several looks in one loop
- **Animation library**: 76 recipes across four categories, including these examples:
  - **Geometric**: Cube, Pyramid, Cylinder, Cone, Sphere, Torus, Möbius Strip, Double Helix, Dodecahedron, Hypercube, Pentachoron (4D), Circular Saw Blade
  - **Energy**: Fire, Energy Field, Energy Wisps, Teleport Column, Portal
  - **Object**: Sword, Knife, Hammer, Arrow, Bullet, Rock, Egg, Coin, Crown, Scythe
  - **Effect**: Hypnotize (seamless Archimedean spiral), Acid Trip (kaleidoscopic mandala)
- **3D pipeline**: Every shape supports static tilts + per-axis rotation cycles, glow halo, textured faces with backface culling, and depth-sorted edges
- **Texture sources**:
  - PNG / JPG / WebP / BMP static images
  - **Animated GIFs**, frames are decoded and played in sync with the animation's loop
  - **Video files** (MP4, WebM, MOV, M4V, OGV, OGG), seek-decoded to per-frame canvases on first load, also synced to the animation loop
- **Export**: Save bake-ready PNG sprite sheets for use in MZ animations *and* save a transparent animated GIF of the live preview for documentation / sharing

#### Effekseer Animation Generator
Recipe-driven generator for native Effekseer particle effects (`.efkefc`), no external Effekseer editor needed. Exports drop straight into the project's `effects/` folder and play through the engine's bundled Effekseer runtime.

- **Format engine**: In-house `.efkefc` reader for binary versions 15, 1500, 1610, and 1710; the writer emits runtime-native version 1500 and is covered by tracked generated-format round trips. The `.efkmodel` writer supports v3 single-frame and v5 multi-frame vertex animation.
- **Recipe library**: 106 recipes across nine categories: Geometric (15), Symbolic (17), Object (12), Interface (21 true-3D instruments with user-entered text), Energy (15), Elements (8), Effect (5), Physical (12), and the Custom Effect Composer.
- **Render styles**: Glowing wireframe struts (energy-line look, texture flow along edges) or Solid textured surfaces, seam-correct UV-sphere mapping, normal-blend faithful texture rendering, and untinted custom textures so e.g. a planet map wraps a sphere like a globe
- **Custom textures**: AG-style picker copies PNG/JPEG images into the project's `effects/Texture/` and maps them across the geometry
- **Playback**: Spinning and steady-state recipes run continuously with degree-per-second controls; effects that need to settle declare preview prewarm, while bounded bursts and keyframed compositions repeat on the master Frames cycle.
- **Live preview**: in-memory playback through the same `effekseer.min.js` WebGL runtime the game uses (data-URL resources, zero disk writes), persistent render loop with background rebuild + seamless effect swap on every slider change
- **3D controls**: left-drag rotates the effect (synced with the rotation gizmo), right/Shift-drag orbits the camera, scroll zooms; orientation is applied in realtime and baked into the exported file via an Always-bound container
- **Layers**: stack any animations into one effect (＋ on each sidebar row), managed beside the preview when space permits and below it on narrow windows; visibility, live-percentage opacity, reorder, duplicate, and Delay/Duration windows merge into one `.efkefc` on export, including opacity applied to animated alpha curves
- **Keyframes**: pin full parameter states to chosen frames per layer; selection, add/delete, frame fields, Start Frame, and layer timing stay synchronized. Transitions compile to native Effekseer curves (colors, size, spin), differing custom textures cross-fade, and the pattern repeats every master cycle (the **Frames** field in the playback bar)
- **Randomize & presets**: a 🎲 Randomize button rolls all parameters (like the standard Animation Generator), and named presets save/recall parameter sets per project (`forge/effekseer_generator/presets.json`)

#### Character Generator
Composable character sprite generator for actor walking sprites and generated outfit parts.

- **Style selector**: `Psychronic` and `Looseleaf` are bundled, with Psychronic selected by default. Project JavaScript and PNG style folders remain supported and load automatically.
- **Procedural tab**: Renders layered ASCII/template parts from the part registry, with configurable frame size, alignment, palette overrides, and 3x4 walking-sheet export
- **Outfit Forge tab**: Generates full-outfit Character Generator parts from recipe data. The bundled `Nova Sentinel` recipe targets both Psychronic and Looseleaf through `procgen/outfits/nova_sentinel.js`. The Legs slot offers a second preset, a procedural **Mini Skirt**, beside the segmented leg armor.
- **Outfit engine**: Browser/Node-compatible generator in `src/forge/CharacterGenerator/procgen/outfit_engine.js`, with per-zone palette families, role-based painters, extensions such as pauldrons/gauntlets, live 4-direction preview, walk preview, zone debug overlays, and save-to-library output under `styles/<style>/parts/full outfits/`
- **Hair Forge tab**: Generates 4-direction walking hair parts with live walk preview, save-to-library output, expanded palettes (`auburn`, `platinum`, `rose`, `violet`, `navy`, `emerald`), front-view Eye Zone controls, and Hair Pattern sliders for lower-hair banding/scraggle or Short Spiky triangular texture.
- **Hair Forge styles**: Includes `Layered Bob`, `Long Layered`, `Short Shag`, `Short Spiky`, and `Center Part Long`. Short Spiky uses style-specific spike silhouettes, spiky side bangs, connected rear spikes, and length-aware back/nape behavior; Center Part Long uses symmetrical straight strands, a visible middle part, smooth side bangs, face-framing long curtains, and subtle walk-frame sway.
- **Template analyzer**: Imports PNG/JPEG/WebP sprite sheets, classifies pixels into material letters, supports material-paint correction, and emits style-specific `RR_CG_BODY_TEMPLATE_SHEETS[style][variant]` snippets for body-template work
- **Parts (PNG) tab**: Layers user-supplied PNG sprite-sheet parts from the active project's `forge/character_generator/styles/<style>/parts/` folder with draggable ordering

#### Sound Effect Generator
Procedural sfxr-style SFX and instrument generator built on Web Audio. Bakes straight to the project's `audio/se/` folder, so a sound effect never has to be sourced outside the editor.

- **Two modes**: **Sound** builds a single one-shot effect; **Pattern** is a 16-step piano-roll sequencer (rows = pitch, columns = 16th notes at a settable BPM) for stingers and jingles
- **Archetype library**: 29 seeds — 20 RPG SFX (hits, lasers, explosions, pickups, footsteps, doors, the four magic elements, UI blips), 8 tuned instruments (Piano, Bass, Pluck, KS Pluck, Pad, Bell, Strings, Brass), and a blank Custom starter
- **Synthesis graph**: source (oscillator, noise, or Karplus-Strong) with optional detuned sub-osc → highpass → resonant lowpass with sweep → distortion → ADSR → tremolo → dry/convolution-reverb split, rebuilt per play so every parameter is live
- **Waveforms**: Sine, Square (variable duty), Sawtooth, Triangle, Noise, and Karplus (Pluck), a physically modelled string
- **27 parameters** in six groups — Source, Envelope, Pitch, Modulation, Filter, Texture — each with an inline description
- **Randomize**: each archetype declares `lockedParams`, so the values defining its identity (a Laser's waveform, an Explosion's highpass) hold steady and a roll stays recognizably that sound
- **Live visualizers**: waveform, envelope, and pitch canvases redraw as sliders move, before playback
- **Export**: 16-bit PCM mono WAV, defaulting to `audio/se/<name>.wav`. Presets and pattern state persist per project under `forge/sound_effect_generator/`

### Theming

Switch the editor's look from **File → Options**:

- **Palettes**: Default (gold), Bubblegum (pink), Ocean (blue), Cascadia (forest green), Underworld (red), Orange Creamsicle (orange/cream), Royalty (purple with gold trim)
- **Modes**: Dark and Light for every palette
- **Palette picker**: Compact swatch dropdown with high-contrast themed rows and selected/hover highlights
- **Map preview**: A persisted File → Options checkbox and compact synchronized `A1` checkbox beside the map zoom/coordinates can pause or resume water and waterfall animation without affecting the game runtime
- Map editor canvas stays dark in every theme (cinematic feel)
- Theme choice persists across sessions in `localStorage`
- All themes built on a single CSS custom-property system (`css/theme.css`); adding a palette is a copy-paste block plus one line in the picker registry

### Localization

Switch the editor language from **File → Options** or the top-menu language button. Language changes apply immediately and persist across sessions in `localStorage`.

- **Languages**: English, Japanese, Spanish, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, German, French, Greek, Korean, Arabic, Italian, Polish, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai, and Turkish
- **Current coverage**: source-routed editor shell, menus, database editors, event-command forms, Forge tools, map/project controls, deployment UI, browser host, common status/alert text, fixed Terms array/message schemas, and every Options palette name/description
- **Architecture**: `src/I18nManager.js` provides keyed dictionaries and runtime binding, checked-in `src/I18nDeepTranslations.js` supplies the offline broad baseline, and `src/I18nReviewedTranslations.js` applies locally reviewed exact-text, keyed, event-command, and event-section corrections last. No translation generator or network service is used. A source inventory recognizes static translation calls and consumed array/object schemas; tests enforce locale/key parity, reviewed precedence, interpolation placeholders, Thai normalization, complete Polish event tables, high-visibility labels, and Arabic `dir="rtl"` behavior
- Project-authored content such as actor/item/switch/map/event/audio names remains untranslated so RPG project data is not modified by editor language changes

## Installation

### From a Release Archive
Download a platform-specific archive from the releases page, extract it, and run the launcher:

#### Linux
```bash
unzip RPGReactor-v*-linux-x64.zip
cd RPGReactor
chmod +x RPGReactor.sh
./RPGReactor.sh
```
The ZIP is a portable folder build and runs in place through `RPGReactor.sh`.

For the optional AppImage artifact:

```bash
chmod +x RPGReactor-v*-linux-x64.AppImage
./RPGReactor-v*-linux-x64.AppImage
```

AppImages normally use FUSE. On systems or containers without working FUSE, launch with `--appimage-extract-and-run`. AppImage improves portability but does not remove NW.js system-library, Chromium sandbox, or kernel requirements; the ZIP remains the fallback distribution.

#### Windows
Extract the `.zip` and double-click `RPG Reactor.exe`.

#### macOS
Extract the `.zip` and open `RPG Reactor.app`. If macOS blocks the first launch, Control-click the app, choose **Open**, and confirm.

### From Source
RPG Reactor runs on NW.js, while dependency installation, tests, and release tooling require Node.js 22 or newer. You also need the NW.js runtime for your platform.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Psychronic-Games/RPGReactor.git
cd RPGReactor/editor

# Install editor dependencies
npm ci

# Download NW.js for your platform and place it here or at the repository root:
#   nwjs-linux/   (Linux)
#   nwjs-win/     (Windows)
#   nwjs-mac/     (macOS)

# Launch with NW.js placed inside editor/
./nwjs-linux/nw .          # Linux
nwjs-win\nw.exe .          # Windows

# Or with NW.js placed at the repository root
../nwjs-linux/nw .         # Linux
..\nwjs-win\nw.exe .       # Windows
# macOS: use ../RPGReactor.command from the repository root
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+N` | New Project |
| `Ctrl+O` | Open Project |
| `Ctrl+S` | Save Project |
| `Ctrl+R` | Launch Playtest |
| `Ctrl+Z` | Undo (map editor and database list) |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Redo |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Redo (alternate) |
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy selected database entry |
| `Ctrl+X` | Cut selected database entry |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste database entry to selected slot |
| `Ctrl+D` | Duplicate selected database entry |
| `Delete` | Delete selected event, delete selected map, or blank selected database entry |
| `F5` | Confirm, then reload the editor without cache (unsaved changes are lost) |
| `F11` | Toggle native fullscreen |
| `F12` | Open NW.js developer tools |

Database shortcuts are scoped to the active database section. The Types workspace adds Ctrl/Cmd-click and Shift-click range selection, Ctrl/Cmd+A/X/C/V, Delete/Backspace clear, arrow navigation, Enter/F2 editing, and the same actions in its right-click menu. Types clipboard rows are newline-separated for transfer between categories or spreadsheets. Terms and Types text fields provide editor-native Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All context menus instead of Chromium's generic menu. Plugin Manager also supports Ctrl+C/X/V and Delete for selected plugin groups. Map tree shortcuts support Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V and Delete for whole-map clipboard/delete actions. Map and event global shortcuts are suppressed while database and editor modals are open.

## Technical Details

- **Runtime**: NW.js; deployment defaults to the editor's runtime version and also supports pinning a specific release
- **Rendering**: PixiJS 8.20.0 for 2D and Three.js 0.185.1 for 3D maps and models, with compatibility shims and bundled PIXI 7-era library support for imported RPG Maker projects/plugins
- **Animation Effects**: Effekseer
- **Data Format**: RPG Maker MZ-compatible JSON plus stock MV-compatible LZString saves. The MV compatibility layer supports synchronous YEP-style local/browser save APIs, including custom directory, filename, and web-storage key contracts
- **Tile Size**: 64, 48, 32, 24, 16, or 8 pixels. Sheet layouts stay fixed; image dimensions scale with the tile size. B–G sheets are each 16×16 tiles.
- **Desktop platforms**: Windows (x64), macOS (x64), Linux (x64)
- **Browser edition**: Modern HTTPS/localhost browsers with service-worker and IndexedDB support

### Tests

The Node test suite covers project creation/import and version metadata, generated-project validity, runtime manifests, local Markdown links, all 18 localization dictionaries, reviewed precedence/routing and no-fallback labels, cross-instance map/database/event clipboard transport, database batch/scroll behavior and trait/effect reference remapping, persisted A1 animation control, exact Shift autotile placement, database limits and Types/Terms behavior, complete Conditional Branch and nested-structure round trips, advanced Control Variables and Game Data operands, stock Loop insertion, dynamic event calls, extended input conditions, dynamic/extended Picture and Video Surface commands, transactional event creation/editing and all four Quick Event generators, visual start locations, Magic Skills, searchable Plugin Help, nested plugin-parameter serialization, typed plugin references, modern image formats, animated GIF refresh, and MZ command blocks, MV saves and visual compatibility, recursive/Unicode assets and folder trees, project lock and atomic-write safety, transactional model import and rollback, package preflights, preview cleanup, deployment/runtime/codec acquisition, release policy/signing gates, Forge generation, editor/Web distribution, Effekseer format/model round trips, all 106 recipes at default/extreme/swept values, composition, real-WASM playback, and the complete custom-interface data/runtime surface. Two sweeps also run every invocation against shapes derived from the bundled RPG Maker-authored projects (vendored in `tests/helpers/authored-data-shapes.json`): each command editor's emitted parameter count versus the highest `params[n]` the matching `Game_Interpreter.commandNNN` reads, and each new-record template versus the fields authored records always carry. The current full-suite result and tested-tree context are recorded in
[`docs/STATUS.md`](../docs/STATUS.md). `npm run smoke:web` drives real Chromium
through save, IndexedDB, and reload; `npm run smoke:nw` launches the editor
through the matching NW.js SDK ChromeDriver and verifies a native project save.
Both are CI gates. `npm run smoke:nw-interactions` also runs in CI: it checks rapid
record changes, retired dialogs, keyboard ownership, delayed map loads and seeded
navigation sequences in a disposable project. Set `RR_INTERACTION_SEED` to replay
another sequence; failures retain the seed and action trace in the uploaded JSON.
All NW.js smokes accept `--nw-root=/path/to/matching/sdk`.
`npm run smoke:nw-ui` checks the responsive interface editor
from 1280x720 through 2560x1440 as a local release gate. Prior GUI passes do not
replace a fresh check of the candidate, and Node tests do not establish visual
correctness or complete game compatibility.

```bash
cd editor
npm test
```

Use **Build → Create Deployment Package...** for game packages and **Build → Package Editor for Distribution...** for editor archives. The direct npm game-build scripts require an explicit project path and acknowledgment that their developer download is not release-authenticated, for example `npm run build:linux -- --project="/path/to/game" --developer-unverified-downloads`.

Each launch randomly selects a splash image. Add PNG artwork to `editor/images/` using names such as `splash-screen-03.png`, `splash-screen-04.png`, and so on (the current artwork is 1920 × 1200). Desktop launches discover these files automatically; rebuild the Web package to include new images there. Numbering gaps are allowed, and the same image may appear on consecutive launches.

### Build Architecture
Both game builds and editor distribution builds use `worker_threads` to run in background threads without blocking the UI. Workers communicate via `postMessage` with `{ type: 'log', message, color }` for build log output and `{ type: 'progress', percent, status }` for progress bar updates. ESM `import()` hangs silently in NW.js worker threads, so all build workers use CommonJS exclusively.
