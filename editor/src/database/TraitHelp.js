/**
 * TraitHelp - one sentence per trait, and per choice inside a trait's dropdown.
 *
 * A trait row says what it is called, not what it does. "Sp-Parameter" does not
 * say that its values multiply where "Ex-Parameter" sums them; "Attack Element"
 * does not say that several of them resolve to the target's worst rate rather
 * than to a product. Those are the things an author actually has to know, and
 * until now the only place they were written down was the engine source.
 *
 * Every sentence here describes what `runtime/reactor_objects.js` really does,
 * checked against it rather than against RPG Maker's documentation - the two
 * disagree in a few places, and the runtime wins.
 *
 * Rows carry their sentence as hover help (see utils/HoverHelp.js). Dropdown
 * choices carry theirs on the <option>'s `title`, which SelectThemingShim
 * already renders as a second line in the popup - the same road ActionScopes
 * takes.
