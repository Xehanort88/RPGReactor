 * Database > Terms > Parameters edits `System.json`'s `terms.params`, and the
 * runtime hands exactly that array to `TextManager.param()`, so a project that
 * renames Attack to Strength says Strength everywhere in play. The editor that
 * authored the rename did not: every database surface carried its own hardcoded
 * copy of the English MZ names, so the Classes curve grid labelled the Strength
 * curve "Attack", the trait dropdown offered "M.Defense" for what the game calls
 * Spirit, and the Enemies page disagreed with the bestiary it feeds. Reading the
 * project's own answer in one place fixes all of them together.
 *
 * A slot the project has NOT renamed still gets the translated English default,
 * so a stock project opened in a Japanese editor keeps showing Japanese instead
 * of the English sitting in its data. Only a name the author actually chose
 * overrides the translation, because only that name is content rather than UI.
 *
 * Slots 8 and 9 are in the same array and on the same Terms page but are not
 * parameters: they name the first two ex-parameters, Hit and Evasion.
