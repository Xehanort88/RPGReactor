/**
 * Objects grouped on the map rather than derived from the tileset.
 *
 * A tileset can say what a *tile* is, and that is all it can say. An autotile
 * id is a corner arrangement shared by forty-eight shapes, so three shops built
 * from one wall kind are the same tile as each other, and no classification can
 * tell them apart. Declaring a rectangle of a sheet does not help either: an
 * autotile has no place in a drawing to declare.
 *
 * So "which cells are one building" cannot be answered anywhere but on the map,
 * and this is where the author answers it.
 *
 * The measurements below are from Moletown, map 612 of Star Shift Rebellion —
 * three shop stalls whose flags slid against the walls they were painted on.
