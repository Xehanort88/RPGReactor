/**
 * Events that place a tile are part of the world.

 * A door, a sign, a chest, a barrel: an author stands most of these up as an
 * event with a tile graphic, not by painting a layer. The scene is built from
 * the map's tile data, which those tiles are not in, so they stayed flat while
 * the identical tile painted one cell over stood up. This is that gap closed —
 * a classified event tile is written into the map the builder sees, so it
