/*
 * An extension of Reactor3D (reactor_3d.js): the lights of a 3D map and the
 * shadows they cast. Loaded right after the core, in the game from
 * scriptUrls, in the editor from Reactor3D.EXTENSIONS, and in Node by the
 * core's own tail so require("./reactor_3d.js") returns the whole API.
 *
 * Four parts, in order: the light model and its shader (light kinds, the
 * light grid, the lit-material shader injection, the cutaway and dissolve
 * that share it, GPU tiering); the shadow atlas; the shims that read a 2D
 * lighting plugin's lights; and the native lights a map carries in its
 * sidecar, with the event commands that switch and move them.

// Lighting
//
// A 2D lighting plugin draws circles and cones onto the screen, which on a 3D
// map is a picture of light rather than light: it lands flat over the world
// instead of pooling on the ground and climbing walls. The geometry is here to
// be lit, so it is lit.
//
// Reactor cannot read a plugin's lights directly without binding itself to one
// plugin's internals, so it publishes a shape and a shim translates. Positions
// are map cells — the same coordinates everything else in this file uses — so a
// shim never has to know about the camera.

 * Lights are drawn, not simulated.
 *
 * The obvious implementation — one `THREE.PointLight` per light — does not
 * survive contact with a real map. three.js sizes its light uniform arrays to
 * the number of lights in the scene and compiles that count into *every*
 * material's shader, so a city with a lantern on every corner overruns the
 * fragment shader's uniform budget, the program fails to link, and the map
 * draws nothing at all. Capping the count to fit is not a fix either: twelve
 * lights on a street of a hundred is not lighting.
 *
 * But a 2D lighting plugin never simulated anything. Its light *is* a shape: a
 * radius, a colour, an alpha — a soft disc it stamps on the screen. That shape
 * is what has to end up on the ground in 3D, and a shape can simply be drawn.
 *
 * So every light becomes a quad lying on the ground, sized to its own radius,
 * tinted by its own colour, added to what is already there. All of them share
 * one geometry and one material, so a hundred lights is one draw call and no
 * shader uniforms whatsoever. The only real light in the scene is a single
 * ambient one, which is the darkness the lights are read against.

 *
 * The ground quads above are a picture of a pool of light: a disc on the
 * floor, a wedge along it, drawn in a pass of their own and added over the
 * frame. Seen from a ground camera the disc is a slice, a wall beside a lamp
 * stays dark, a lamp on a ceiling lights nothing, and the light's own height
 * has nowhere to go. "Volume" mode makes the light a field instead: every map
 * material — tiles, cut-outs, room walls, models, characters — takes the
 * map's lights as shader uniforms and lights each pixel by its distance from
 * every source, in three dimensions. A point light is a sphere of reach that
 * falls on the floor below it, the wall beside it and the ceiling above; a
 * spotlight is a cone with a yaw *and a pitch*. The source itself is shown
 * as a faint glowing body (a sphere, or the cone) that walls hide, because it
 * is geometry in the world like everything else.
 *
 * The uniform-budget argument against `THREE.PointLight` still holds, so the
 * list is capped per shader: the nearest `SHADER_LIGHTS` to the focus are
 * uploaded each frame, once, into value objects every lit material shares.
 * A map can keep the flat quads with `lighting.mode = "flat"` in its sidecar,
 * and `Reactor3D.LIGHT_MODE = "flat"` restores them everywhere.
